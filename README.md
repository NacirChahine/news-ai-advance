- **NLP/AI**: NLTK, spaCy, Transformers, PyTorch, Ollama (local LLMs)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Gathering**: Newspaper3k, Requests, BeautifulSoup4

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following Django apps:

- **news_aggregator**: Handles news article collection and storage
- **news_analysis**: Performs AI analysis of news content (bias detection, sentiment analysis, ML summarization)
- **accounts**: Manages user authentication, saved articles, and user preferences

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- spaCy english model: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NacirChahine/news-ai-advance.git
   cd newsAdvance
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set up environment variables
   ```bash
   # The .env file is already configured with working email settings
   # You can modify it if needed for your specific configuration
   # For new setups, you can copy from the template:
   # cp .env.example .env
   ```

6. Download NLP (Natural Language Processing) resources
   ```bash
   python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon punkt stopwords
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

7. Run migrations
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

8. Create a superuser (for admin access)
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

9. Start the development server
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

10. Access the site at http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Running the Project

After installation, you can run the project using:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Generating Test Data

To populate the site with test data for development purposes:

```bash
python manage.py generate_test_data --sources 10 --articles 30 --users 5
```

### News Fetching

To fetch news articles from configured sources:

```bash
python manage.py fetch_news
```


### Health Check

Run environment diagnostics to verify your setup:

```bash
python manage.py health_check
# Verbose mode (shows extra details and hints)
python manage.py health_check --verbose
```

What it checks:
- Python version (supported range 3.8‚Äì3.12; recommended 3.11/3.12)
- Virtual environment usage
- Core dependencies: Django, BeautifulSoup4 (`bs4`), `sgmllib` (from `sgmllib3k`), Newspaper3k (`newspaper`), NLTK, spaCy, Transformers
- Database connectivity (simple query)
- NLTK data availability (`punkt`, `vader_lexicon`)
- spaCy English model availability (`en_core_web_sm`)
- Ollama connectivity (optional; only if `OLLAMA_ENDPOINT` is set)
- Static files presence (static/css, static/js)

Interpreting results:
- "OK" means the check passed
- "WARN" indicates an optional or environment-specific issue; the project should still run
- "FAIL" indicates a problem to fix; the command exits with a non-zero status when any failures occur

Notes:
- Newspaper3k and lxml cleaner: With lxml>=5, the HTML cleaner was split out. If you see a warning like:
  "lxml.html.clean module is now a separate project lxml_html_clean", you can install either `lxml[html_clean]` or `lxml_html_clean`. This is treated as a WARN by default since Newspaper3k is optional in this project.

### Analyzing Articles

To analyze articles for bias, sentiment, and generate summaries:

1. **Add an Article via Admin Panel**
   - Go to the admin panel at `/admin/`
   - Log in with your admin credentials
   - Navigate to "News articles" under the "News_aggregator" section
   - Click "Add News article" and fill in the required fields
   - Make sure to leave `is_analyzed` unchecked
   - Save the article

2. **Run the Analysis Command**
   ```bash
   python manage.py analyze_articles
   ```

   Options:
   ```bash
   # To analyze a specific article by ID
   python manage.py analyze_articles --article_id 123

   # To limit the number of articles processed
   python manage.py analyze_articles --limit 10

   # To force reanalysis of previously analyzed articles
   python manage.py analyze_articles --force

   # To choose an AI model for analysis (requires Ollama)
   python manage.py analyze_articles --model llama3
   python manage.py analyze_articles --model qwen2:1.5b
   python manage.py analyze_articles --model deepseek-r1:8b
   ```

   # To toggle AI usage (defaults to on)
   python manage.py analyze_articles --use-ai


3. **Verify the Results**
   - Return to the admin panel
   - Check that your article now has `is_analyzed` set to True
   - Navigate to "Bias analyses" and "Sentiment analyses" under the "News_analysis" section
   - You should see entries for your article with the analysis results

   - On the article page, a ‚ÄúKey Insights‚Äù collapsible section appears below the summary when insights are available.

#### Using Test Data Generator

For testing with multiple articles at once:

```bash
python manage.py generate_test_data --sources 5 --articles 10 --users 2
```

This will create:
- 5 news sources
- 10 articles per source (50 total)
- 2 test users
- Analysis data for most articles


## Features

### News Aggregation
- Collection and storage of news articles from multiple sources
- Source credibility ratings and filtering
- Personalized news feed based on topics of interest
- Save articles to your personal collection with notes


### Sources Overview
- Browse all sources at `/news/sources/` with reliability scores, political bias indicators (Left/Center/Right), and article counts.
- Click a source to view its articles (`/news/source/<id>/`).
- Also accessible from the navbar under Analysis Tools ‚Üí Sources Overview.

### News Analysis
- Political bias detection and visualization using advanced NLP techniques
- Sentiment analysis to detect emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral)
- Named entity recognition and extraction
- Readability scoring and complexity analysis
- Visual indicators for source reliability and content bias
- Logical fallacy reference and detection (catalog + admin + per-article detections with user toggle and public reference page). Catalog now includes anchor links and dedicated detail pages for each fallacy.

- Advanced AI analysis using local LLMs via Ollama integration
- Key insights extraction and display (collapsible panel on article pages)


### Display Preferences (Summary & Key Insights)
- New user preference toggles in Accounts ‚Üí Preferences:
  - enable_summary_display (default: True)
  - enable_key_insights (default: True)
- Behavior on article pages:
  - Visitors (not logged in): AI Summary and Key Insights are shown by default
  - Logged-in users: Sections are shown only if the corresponding toggle is enabled

### Key Insights UI
- The Key Insights section is expanded by default and uses a collapse toggle with an arrow:
  - ‚ñ≤ when expanded, ‚ñº when collapsed
- Implemented via static/js/article_detail.js; styling via static/css/article_detail.css

### Static Assets
- Inline CSS/JS moved to static files:
  - CSS: static/css/site.css, static/css/article_detail.css
  - JS: static/js/article_detail.js, static/js/preferences.js
- Templates now include `{% load static %}` and reference these files (see base.html and article_detail.html)

### Source Reliability Scoring
- NewsSource.reliability_score is automatically updated after article analysis and can be recalculated in bulk:
  - Per-article update occurs at the end of `analyze_articles`
  - Bulk recalculation:
    ```bash
    python manage.py recalculate_reliability
    # or only sources with zero score
    python manage.py recalculate_reliability --only-zero
    ```
- Scoring considers:
  - Fact-check ratings (weighted) ~60%
  - Bias consistency (lower variance is better) ~20%
  - Logical fallacy frequency (fewer per article is better) ~20%
- On article pages, source reliability is displayed rounded to 3 decimals (e.g., 87.679/100)


#### Logical Fallacies
- Public reference page: visit `/analysis/fallacies/` for the catalog (name, description, example, detection counts). Each item has a URL anchor and a link icon for easy sharing.
- Detail pages: `/analysis/fallacies/<slug>/` show the fallacy details and a paginated list of articles where it was detected.
- User preference: Accounts ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí "Enable Logical Fallacy Analysis" controls visibility on article pages
- Article pages:
  - Interactions: From the catalog detail page, each detection entry links directly to the highlighted location within the article. On article pages, hovering over an evidence excerpt glows the corresponding text; clicking scrolls smoothly and highlights for a few seconds.
  - Article Detail: shows detected fallacies when enabled (with confidence and evidence excerpt); each detection links directly to the catalog anchor and has a Details link
  - Analysis View: includes a "Logical Fallacies" card listing detections with anchor and Details links
- Pipeline: `analyze_articles` runs fallacy detection with Ollama when available; unknown labels are skipped unless added to the catalog (Admin > News Analysis > Logical fallacies)
- Seed data: catalog seeded with 25+ common fallacies (e.g., Appeal to Authority, Bandwagon, Slippery Slope, Red Herring, Circular Reasoning, Appeal to Emotion, Hasty Generalization, Begging the Question, Appeal to Ignorance, Cherry Picking, Gambler's Fallacy, etc.)


  - Robust highlighting: When character positions are missing/inaccurate, the article page falls back to searching the evidence excerpt within the rendered text (case-insensitive, then fuzzy token match) and highlights the first match; otherwise, it gracefully degrades (excerpt shown in sidebar only).
  - Clickable highlights: Highlighted spans are accessible links with tooltips (name + brief description) that navigate to the fallacy detail page for deeper context.
  - Exact alignment: Stored positions are saved in display-space indices (CR/LF removed) to match the DOM text produced by the `linebreaks` filter.


### User System
  - User authentication and profile management
  - Personalized news preferences
  - Saved articles with notes

### Misinformation Tracking
  - **Models & Infrastructure**: Complete database models for alerts and fact-checking
  - **Manual Fact-Checking**: Admin interface for creating fact-check results
  - **Source Reliability**: Basic reliability scoring system
  - **Automated Detection**: *In development* - Real-time misinformation detection pipeline


### Misinformation Alerts (Manual Management and Email Notifications)

- Manage alerts in Django Admin: Admin > News Analysis > Misinformation alerts
  - Actions: Mark resolved, Mark active, Send alert email to opted-in users
  - Link related articles via the ManyToMany field on the alert

- Send email notifications to users who enabled alerts in their preferences:
  - From Admin: select alert(s) > action "Send alert email to opted-in users"
  - From CLI:
    ```bash
    python manage.py send_misinformation_alerts --active-only --since 2025-01-01
    python manage.py send_misinformation_alerts --alert-id 123
    python manage.py send_misinformation_alerts --dry-run --since 2025-01-01
    ```

- Article analysis integration
  - During analyze_articles, the system matches articles to active alerts using keyword overlap and links them (no new alerts are created automatically)
  - Article Analysis page shows a "Misinformation Alerts" card when related active alerts exist
  - AI summary prompts can include a brief list of related alerts as context (non-breaking)


## Fact-Checking

- Fact-check results are displayed on the article detail page in a dedicated accordion.
- Automated pipeline:
  - Claim extraction: up to 3‚Äì5 verifiable claims are extracted from article content using NLP heuristics (entities, numbers, quotes, reporting verbs).
  - LLM verification: Each claim is verified via Ollama, producing a rating (true/mostly_true/half_true/mostly_false/false/pants_on_fire/unverified), an explanation, sources, and a confidence score. Rate-limited to avoid API saturation.
  - Stored fields now include confidence and last_verified timestamps. The UI shows ratings and explanations; sources are listed when provided.
- Users can control visibility:
  - Go to Accounts > Preferences and toggle ‚ÄúEnable Fact-Checking‚Äù.
  - If disabled, the article page shows a hint with a link back to Preferences to enable it.
- For visitors who aren‚Äôt logged in, the article page shows a helpful prompt with links to sign up or log in to access fact-checks.

CLI tips:

```bash
# Analyze one article (extract + verify claims)
python manage.py analyze_articles --article_id <ID> --force

# Periodically re-verify older fact checks
python manage.py reverify_fact_checks --older-than-days 14 --limit 50
```

Configuration:
- Set OLLAMA_ENDPOINT (default http://localhost:11434/api/generate) if needed.
- Ensure an Ollama model (default: llama3) is available locally.

## ML-Powered News Summarization

News Advance includes a fine-tuned BART model specifically trained on the BBC News Summary dataset for high-quality article summarization. This provides more accurate and consistent summaries compared to general-purpose models.

### Features

- **High-Quality Summaries**: Trained on professional news writing from BBC dataset
- **Fast Inference**: Optimized for quick summarization
- **Configurable Length**: Control summary length and detail level
- **Seamless Fallback**: Automatically falls back to Ollama if the ML model isn't available

### Training the Model

To train your own summarization model:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd news_analysis/ml_models
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   cd summarization
   train_model.bat  # On Windows
   # OR
   python train_summarization_model.py --model_name facebook/bart-base --output_dir ./trained_model
   ```

3. Training parameters (adjust in `train_model.bat` or pass as arguments):
   - `--model_name`: Base model (default: facebook/bart-base)
   - `--output_dir`: Where to save the trained model
   - `--num_train_epochs`: Training epochs (default: 3)
   - `--batch_size`: Batch size (default: 4)
   - `--learning_rate`: Learning rate (default: 5e-5)
   - `--max_input_length`: Max input tokens (default: 1024)
   - `--max_target_length`: Max summary tokens (default: 128)

### Using the ML Summarizer

The ML-based summarizer is automatically used when available. You can control its behavior in `news_advance/settings.py`:

```python
# ML Models Configuration
SUMMARIZATION_MODEL_DIR = BASE_DIR / 'news_analysis' / 'ml_models' / 'summarization' / 'trained_model'
SUMMARIZATION_BASE_MODEL = 'facebook/bart-base'  # Fallback if trained model not available
USE_ML_SUMMARIZATION = True  # Set to False to always use Ollama instead
```

### Performance

The model is evaluated using ROUGE metrics:
- ROUGE-1: ~40-45%
- ROUGE-2: ~20-25%
- ROUGE-L: ~35-40%

## Ollama Integration

News Advance supports integration with [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) for advanced AI analysis using local large language models (LLMs). This integration provides:

- Enhanced article summarization (fallback when ML model not used)
- More nuanced sentiment analysis
- Advanced political bias detection
- Key insights extraction from articles

### Setting Up Ollama

1. Install Ollama from [https://ollama.ai/download](https://ollama.ai/download)
2. Download recommended models:
   ```bash
