   ```bash
   # To analyze a specific article by ID
   python manage.py analyze_articles --article_id 123

   # To limit the number of articles processed
   python manage.py analyze_articles --limit 10

   # To force reanalysis of previously analyzed articles
   python manage.py analyze_articles --force

   # To choose an AI model for analysis (requires Ollama)
   python manage.py analyze_articles --model llama3
   python manage.py analyze_articles --model qwen2:1.5b
   python manage.py analyze_articles --model deepseek-r1:8b
   ```

3. **Verify the Results**
   - Return to the admin panel
   - Check that your article now has `is_analyzed` set to True
   - Navigate to "Bias analyses" and "Sentiment analyses" under the "News_analysis" section
   - You should see entries for your article with the analysis results

#### Using Test Data Generator

For testing with multiple articles at once:

```bash
python manage.py generate_test_data --sources 5 --articles 10 --users 2
```

This will create:
- 5 news sources
- 10 articles per source (50 total)
- 2 test users
- Analysis data for most articles


## Features

### News Aggregation
- Collection and storage of news articles from multiple sources
- Source credibility ratings and filtering
- Personalized news feed based on topics of interest
- Save articles to your personal collection with notes

### News Analysis
- Political bias detection and visualization using advanced NLP techniques
- Sentiment analysis to detect emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral)
- Named entity recognition and extraction
- Readability scoring and complexity analysis
- Visual indicators for source reliability and content bias
- Logical fallacy reference and detection (catalog + admin + per-article detections with user toggle and public reference page)

- Advanced AI analysis using local LLMs via Ollama integration

#### Logical Fallacies
- Public reference page: visit `/analysis/fallacies/` for the catalog (name, description, example, detection counts)
- User preference: Accounts ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí "Enable Logical Fallacy Analysis" controls visibility on article pages
- Article pages:
  - Article Detail: shows detected fallacies when enabled (with confidence and evidence excerpt)
  - Analysis View: includes a "Logical Fallacies" card listing detections and a link to the reference page
- Pipeline: `analyze_articles` runs fallacy detection with Ollama when available; unknown labels are skipped unless added to the catalog (Admin > News Analysis > Logical fallacies)


### User System
  - User authentication and profile management
  - Personalized news preferences
  - Saved articles with notes

### Misinformation Tracking
  - **Models & Infrastructure**: Complete database models for alerts and fact-checking
  - **Manual Fact-Checking**: Admin interface for creating fact-check results
  - **Source Reliability**: Basic reliability scoring system
  - **Automated Detection**: *In development* - Real-time misinformation detection pipeline


### Misinformation Alerts (Manual Management and Email Notifications)

- Manage alerts in Django Admin: Admin > News Analysis > Misinformation alerts
  - Actions: Mark resolved, Mark active, Send alert email to opted-in users
  - Link related articles via the ManyToMany field on the alert

- Send email notifications to users who enabled alerts in their preferences:
  - From Admin: select alert(s) > action "Send alert email to opted-in users"
  - From CLI:
    ```bash
    python manage.py send_misinformation_alerts --active-only --since 2025-01-01
    python manage.py send_misinformation_alerts --alert-id 123
    python manage.py send_misinformation_alerts --dry-run --since 2025-01-01
    ```

- Article analysis integration
  - During analyze_articles, the system matches articles to active alerts using keyword overlap and links them (no new alerts are created automatically)
  - Article Analysis page shows a "Misinformation Alerts" card when related active alerts exist
  - AI summary prompts can include a brief list of related alerts as context (non-breaking)


## Fact-Checking

- Fact-check results are displayed on the article detail page in a dedicated accordion.
- Automated pipeline:
  - Claim extraction: up to 3‚Äì5 verifiable claims are extracted from article content using NLP heuristics (entities, numbers, quotes, reporting verbs).
  - LLM verification: Each claim is verified via Ollama, producing a rating (true/mostly_true/half_true/mostly_false/false/pants_on_fire/unverified), an explanation, sources, and a confidence score. Rate-limited to avoid API saturation.
  - Stored fields now include confidence and last_verified timestamps. The UI shows ratings and explanations; sources are listed when provided.
- Users can control visibility:
  - Go to Accounts > Preferences and toggle ‚ÄúEnable Fact-Checking‚Äù.
  - If disabled, the article page shows a hint with a link back to Preferences to enable it.
- For visitors who aren‚Äôt logged in, the article page shows a helpful prompt with links to sign up or log in to access fact-checks.

CLI tips:

```bash
# Analyze one article (extract + verify claims)
python manage.py analyze_articles --article_id <ID> --force

# Periodically re-verify older fact checks
python manage.py reverify_fact_checks --older-than-days 14 --limit 50
```

Configuration:
- Set OLLAMA_ENDPOINT (default http://localhost:11434/api/generate) if needed.
- Ensure an Ollama model (default: llama3) is available locally.

## ML-Powered News Summarization

News Advance includes a fine-tuned BART model specifically trained on the BBC News Summary dataset for high-quality article summarization. This provides more accurate and consistent summaries compared to general-purpose models.

### Features

- **High-Quality Summaries**: Trained on professional news writing from BBC dataset
- **Fast Inference**: Optimized for quick summarization
- **Configurable Length**: Control summary length and detail level
- **Seamless Fallback**: Automatically falls back to Ollama if the ML model isn't available

### Training the Model

To train your own summarization model:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd news_analysis/ml_models
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   cd summarization
   train_model.bat  # On Windows
   # OR
   python train_summarization_model.py --model_name facebook/bart-base --output_dir ./trained_model
   ```

3. Training parameters (adjust in `train_model.bat` or pass as arguments):
   - `--model_name`: Base model (default: facebook/bart-base)
   - `--output_dir`: Where to save the trained model
   - `--num_train_epochs`: Training epochs (default: 3)
   - `--batch_size`: Batch size (default: 4)
   - `--learning_rate`: Learning rate (default: 5e-5)
   - `--max_input_length`: Max input tokens (default: 1024)
   - `--max_target_length`: Max summary tokens (default: 128)

### Using the ML Summarizer

The ML-based summarizer is automatically used when available. You can control its behavior in `news_advance/settings.py`:

```python
# ML Models Configuration
SUMMARIZATION_MODEL_DIR = BASE_DIR / 'news_analysis' / 'ml_models' / 'summarization' / 'trained_model'
SUMMARIZATION_BASE_MODEL = 'facebook/bart-base'  # Fallback if trained model not available
USE_ML_SUMMARIZATION = True  # Set to False to always use Ollama instead
```

### Performance

The model is evaluated using ROUGE metrics:
- ROUGE-1: ~40-45%
- ROUGE-2: ~20-25%
- ROUGE-L: ~35-40%

## Ollama Integration

News Advance supports integration with [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) for advanced AI analysis using local large language models (LLMs). This integration provides:

- Enhanced article summarization (fallback when ML model not used)
- More nuanced sentiment analysis
- Advanced political bias detection
- Key insights extraction from articles

### Setting Up Ollama
