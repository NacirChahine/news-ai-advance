You are responsible for maintaining perfect synchronization between README.md (for humans) and AI_PROJECT_DOCS.md (for AI context). Key rules:

Updates: Any change to project scope, setup, APIs, or workflows must be reflected in both files.

Detail: AI_PROJECT_DOCS.md should include additional technical depth (e.g., architecture, edge cases) beyond README.md.

Validation: Before finalizing edits, cross-check:
Do both files describe the same core functionality?
Are examples/commands consistent?

Flag: If conflicts arise, ask for human clarification before proceeding.
